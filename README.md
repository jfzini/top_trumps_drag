## Stacks and abilities 💻

This project was made mostly with React with a bit of DOM manipulation, HTML and CSS.
All the animations were made entirely using CSS and components life cycle, no special lib was used.

## Feats in development 🚧

I'm currently working on the game itself, so the user can play against the machine. Watch this repository to keep track of it.
